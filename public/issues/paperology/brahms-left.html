<h2>What is it?</h2>
<img src="/issues/paperology/brahms1.jpg" />
<p>I wanted to try out different techniques with these four small drawings: At the top right you will find a pen and ink drawing on natural white paper. Below you will find a red chalk drawing on blue paper; this paper was already coloured blue in the paper mill; the colour gave the impetus for the artists to use it for more complex modelling, so I added white chalk. To the lower left, I prepared the paper myself with a blue wash and used white chalk again, but this time over graphite. And finally, top left, a coloured-ground drawing with an opaque preparation; the latter is crucial for metal points (a former pencil) that would not be visible on water-based surfaces.</p>

<h2>Where, when, and why?</h2>
<p>As I specialise in the art-historical study of early modern drawings, I am very interested in their techniques. In my dissertation, I investigated the tradition of coloured-ground drawings north of the Alps up to Albrecht Dürer (2016). It is therefore crucial to know that this particular technique, which makes the experimentation of a more complex light and shadow modelling before painting possible in the first place, dates back to the early 14th century in Italy and the late 14th century in the Netherlands. The early date of the latter is ignored by most experts, and with it the artistic expertise in the North, which came about either through a lively exchange or a parallel invention.</p>
