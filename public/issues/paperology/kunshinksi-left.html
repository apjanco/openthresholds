<p>There are two themes underlying my contribution to the Paperology book, both of which are gestured to on the cover. The first theme is called upon in the title – “Paper or Textile?” – and the second is the substrate that the title appears on: the cardboard mailer that contained the little book that would become my contribution.</p>

<p>I had been contemplating my contribution to the Paperology book since its conception at the end of 2020. Having helped to plan the logistics of its circulation I always knew that I would be one of the last people to contribute. What I hadn’t anticipated was that within the year and a half of the book’s travel, I too would move - first, from Toronto to just outside of Boston, and then eventually to Los Angeles. Paper’s long standing significance in the transmission of messages, information, and affects was a central aspect of both the Paperology Reading and Activity Group and the basis of the book project. While much of our interactions as a group happened online, paper was the primary medium of our connection - it was the shared site of inquiry in which we came together. For me, paper was particularly entangled with distanced communication and remote correspondence. Having started my post-doctoral research at Artefact Lab a few weeks prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, what was meant to be an opportunity to convene in-person became entirely remote. Through this, the intimacy and distance underlying remote correspondence became a particularly meaningful site of inquiry. The blank little book that would become my contribution arrived to my new home in Los Angeles from Montréal at a time when I was unable to travel outside of the United States. Moreover, I was unable to see, feel, and engage with the book in its full form when it was on display at the Paperology Symposium in Montréal as I had originally planned. In some sense, my contribution is marked by my isolation in Southern California – which eventually became a site for my exploration of the history of paper production in the Southwest.</p>

<p>Beyond this theme of “distance” that is marked on the cover of my contribution, its contents were inspired by research conducted with Aleksandra Kaminska examining the gendered roles of sorting and inspecting, particularly in the historical context of paper manufacturing. The similarities between women’s roles in the operations of textile mills and paper mills became exemplary of the blurred lines between paper and textile at the time of industrialization. Following the Paperology Reading and Activity Group, I spent some time in the Berkshires at the Crane Museum of Papermaking archives. I found myself immersed in the history of the region exploring these intersections between the manufacture of paper and textiles. My contribution represents a small collection of “specimens” that complicate the distinction between paper and textile. The first inclusion is “rags” accompanied by a photograph of the rag-sorters at the Crane Paper Mill in Dalton, Massachusetts. Also included are serviettes, or napkins, as the advent of new processes of pulp paper manufacture saw to the popular replacement cloth items by disposable paper substitutes. More contemporary applications include Tyvek, a textile made from synthetic fibre that uncannily resembles both paper and cloth, though constitutionally similar and dissimilar to both. The blank pages in the book invite possible future inclusions for other paper-textile hybrids. Each of the specimens that were included came from around my house - reminding me of the “domestic” qualities of papers (a theme that often came up in the Paperology Reading and Activity Group - especially during our meeting on “Paper Intimacy”). My inclusion of paper sewing patterns and my choice to embellish some of the inclusions with hand embroidery and machine stitching called on my personal history with paper in learning how to sew. My first experience using a sewing machine was tracing images on paper, the needle leaving a trail of perforations in the paper – this memory came to mind often when researching the processes of the “finishing room” of Crane and Company. </p>
