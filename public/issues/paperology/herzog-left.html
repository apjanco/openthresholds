<p>Paperology emerged from a very particular circumstance, when the entire globe was responding to the Covid 19 pandemic, and when those of us who had the resources to live comfortably in isolation were doing so. Thanks to the energy and imaginations of Paperology’s organizers, and willingness of its participants a diverse group of thinkers and practitioners came together virtually around a compelling topic with tendrils that reach deep into many aspects of culture. This convergence of spacial and temporal forces had a serendipitous effect on my life. Although I haven’t been able to participate actively in Paperology since my life has returned to its pre-pandemic pace, I’m happy to know that it has endured for others. For me Paperology has, itself, assumed an ephemeral quality, and lives on more in dream like memory than in daily reality. It was a wonderful vehicle to share ideas and research, and to reflect on time, space, matter and change in what felt like a profoundly uncertain moment.</p>

<p>I'm a visual artist who uses material culture to consider aspects of ephemerality, entropy, pleasure and pain; I have a particular interest in textiles and the ways in which they reflect the global migration of technology and culture. I also have a paper-making practice in which I combine pigmented paper pulp with textiles. Paper is a material whose production and history are related to textiles, with similar environmental and social impacts on an industrial scale.</p>

<p>I think about technology as something that exists in a continuum of space and time, from the ancient to the current, the artisanal to the digital, the expeditious to the painstaking. My work can be described as a form of domestic archeology, often engaging architecture and other more intimate forms of material culture. Through a process of accumulation and excavation I create and reveal relationships between disparate elements.</p>

<p>My contribution to this book was inspired by a collection of recycled security envelopes that I’ve saved because I thought they would come in handy. I love the printed patterns on their interiors that were designed to make them so secure. These single use, utilitarian envelopes weren’t meant to be admired, or conserved. Their beauty is incidental, and for this reason, they are the embodiment of ephemera. When viewed retrospectively they become artifacts; hallmarks of the moment when they were relevant. We might ask how much longer they will retain their relevance in our world. Envelopes are pockets with flaps and sometimes windows! They relate to the art of origami and to the book form. Here I have combined them with swatches of pigmented handmade paper, contrasting a precise uninflected industrial ethos with an irregular textured handmade aesthetic; hoping to draw attention to the easily over looked details of each. I’ve inserted them on an axis that is perpendicular to the spine of the book so that they are like pages to be leafed through in a different direction than the rest of the book.</p
