<p>The materiality of paper since early modernity has not been limited to the first-order cultural techniques of writing, drawing and computing; not merely as a surface, but as a modular and plastic medium, paper has lent itself to endless techniques of physical transformation – by folding, cutting, pasting and modelling – which, in turn, have called for different modes of visual, tactile and conceptual engagement. In its broadest sense, then, paper is play – a principle which also led to the construction of this paperological object.</p>

<p>At my children’s request, I built a simple, fully operational boardgame – repurposing a notebook to lay out a basic dice race track with numbered squares – a distillation, of sorts, of several classic models of the genre (such as the Royal Game of the Goose, with its legacies of moral education) as well as several handmade games I recall from my childhood spent in 1980s Eastern Europe. I had been working for a while with texts on cultures of publicity and the circulation of periodical literature since the nineteenth century, so this aspect too went into the composition of my paperological toy: advertisement clippings from Wilhelmine-era German illustrated journals found their way into the design of the squares, side by side with postal stamps issued in Socialist Romania, as tokens allowing the players to traverse several historical discourses of cultural and political ideology at once. Aren’t postal relays and their paper infrastructures not the media-technological conditions that ground our belief in communication?</p>

<p>But perhaps something far less systematic led to the final design: a return to a text I had revisited for a lecture, Walter Benjamin’s 1928 chronicle of the “Toy Exhibition at the Märkisches Museum.” There it was, the invitation to recall that toys (and paper ephemera particularly) come from the margins, as an eclectic array of fragments which are shuffled, like a deck of cards, by nostalgic flashes of memory yet, by the same token, are also patched and patterned into new shapes. The main techniques I used to finally put my toy together –collages, ink-blots and cut-outs – might have just as well told a different story. One that continues, as paper, to resist reduction to a single medium or form.</p>
