<p>From the earliest meetings of the Paperology Research and Activity Group (Paperology RAG) in the Fall of 2020, the organizers put forward the following questions: What kind of work could we do together, beyond reading, discussion, and demonstration? What could the “activity” component of the “research and activity group” look like? These questions sparked my imagination in terms of thinking about the difficulty of documentation. We had Zoom chat logs, posts from a Google classroom website, PDFs of readings, and our own notes, but these various forms failed to capture the feeling of being a part of the Paperology RAG. We had files, but could we make an experiential file, one that would be handmade, and both personal but also collaborative?</p>

<p>I began to think about designing a collaborative activity that would leverage the texture of our connection, including the texture of paper, which was our shared object of inquiry. The idea of a collaborative book project occurred to me. We could mail this collaboratively-made book around the world to each other, and contribute to its growth over time. As a Games scholar, the notion of a playful form of documentation that was focused not on completeness or fidelity but rather affective experience appealed to me. I hoped this playful spirit would be inviting to others, as well. I decided to create a blank book that was not quite blank in the traditional sense. I wanted to use interactive paper forms in such a way that they could invite the playful creativity of others.</p>

<p>These images show several pages of design sketching from my notebook about how to make a book for the Paperology group to co-create in and with. Some of my initial ideas were overly deterministic, such as the thought to create one page per month of the year. Other ideas had sticking power, such as the though to include different types of paper in some way.</p>

<p>A guiding principle for me in developing the design was to think about the object as an <em>invitation</em> to others, similar to the way in which a toy invites play. I wanted to create a book object that would so delight the beholder that they would be easily inspired to join in and co-create, regardless of prior book-making or paper arts experience. This thinking led me to the idea of the enclosure and the envelope form, and the pleasures of giving and receiving paper mail. I thought about a long set of accordion fold pages, with a little envelope affixed to each page, each with its own enclosure of some kind. </p>

<p>I then considered theming each page in the large accordion fold, an idea I later threw out as overly deterministic again. Instead, I thought about including some additional structures affixed to the inside of the cover, including a large, fold-out map that would be blank. I was hoping this blank map might be an invitation to someone to map the community, map the scholarship, map the concepts we moved through together, or even map the trajectory of the <em>Paperology: An Ephemeral Portrait</em> book itself as it moved through various global postal systems. </p>

<p>As I got to work at my craft table, my ideas began to develop and change right away, by working with my hands and the actual book-making materials. For example, working with the chip boards for making the cover of the book, I chose a horizontal orientation for the book instead of a vertical one as I had originally sketched. This horizontal orientation felt more inviting in the hand somehow, and was also broader and more expansive, allowing the central accordion-fold pages to expand to an even wider length. I also came up with the idea to add two miniature books in addition to the map as extra structures affixed inside the back cover, as well as multiple enclosures throughout the pages. I kept thinking about how I could maximise the surfaces of “invitation” to others. </p>

<p>In terms of the envelopes affixed to the accordion pages, these were handmade and each held a sample of a different kind of paper: brown Kraft paper, deli paper, different weights of art papers, handmade papers, a sample of Swedish wallpaper, a strip of multi-coloured flocked velour papers, and even a polypropylene paper known as <em>yupo</em> paper, which we might debate about being paper at all! See figures X - XX for images of the completed substrate or “blank” version of the book.</p>

<p>My last step was to inscribe the book with the following dedication:</p>

<blockquote>
To My Fellow Paperologists: <br>
Thank you for extending fibres of connection in such a fraught time. I hope you will bring that same spirit of generous & generative creativity to this material text. <br>
-Skövde, Sweden, December 2020
</blockquote>

<p>I then shared the book in a video at our December 2020 research group meeting (the video can be accessed here: Add URL). The group was very receptive, with many signing up to receive the book and contribute right away. One group member even typed into the chat that day after watching the video: “My desire to touch this object is almost overwhelming.” This response felt very encouraging to me, as I hoped it indicated a strong will to participate from many in the group. After Christmas, I packed up the book in layers of bubble wrap and an archival box, and set that inside a reused Amazon box (the cardboard calling card of the pandemic), and I shipped the book out to its first stop in Vienna, Austria. </p>

<p>As the project developed and more and more community members contributed their creative work, at many paper-based historical traditions have emerged as key precedents to our book: the commonplace book; the scrapbook; the encyclopaedia; the card catalogue; and correspondence art or mail art. Next I briefly discuss the history and significance of these forms, and how the <em>Paperology: An Ephemeral Portrait</em> book resonates with these traditions. </p>

<p>The history of the commonplace book began as a metaphorical “place” and method of storing and organising information, and was conceived of in the classical period, as written about by Aristotle and Cicero (CITE). Their theoretical book concept did not take actual, material book form until later in the medieval and early modern periods. This later materialised commonplace book was a place to copy down, place in relation, and variously organise extracts from works by others, to be used later in constructing your own argument or book. The commonplace book was often created well before the draft phase or even the concept phase of a later book project (CITE). It was created as a space of early germination. As so the form was not focused on product (the eventual manuscript) but rather on process; a slow process which we might understand as a kind of pre-citation methodology. </p>

<p>Later Renaissance-era versions of the commonplace book made by scholars organised quotations into a grid under topic headings. In 1670 John Locke published a book titled “A new method of a commonplace book” in which he laid out detailed instructions for how to organise information via an index. We can see resonance between this history of the commonplace book and the contemporary forms of commonplace books, for example bullet journals. Like Locke’s approach, bullet journaling places value of rigour, complexity, and organisation, but also draws on scrapbooking, traditional journaling, and diary-keeping, along with the modern mania for personal metrics, tracking, personal data, and personal measurement .</p>

<p>The commonplace book is related to the notebook, journal, scrapbook, and other forms. In relation to the notebook, scholar Jillian Hess has noted the gendered usages of the terms “commonplace book” versus “notebook” by creators, pointing out that women more often labeled their works commonplace books, emphasising intertextual entanglement, while men more often labeled their books as notebooks, foregrounding a frame of single authorship (Hess 2018). It is interesting to reflect on the differences between what the two terms communicate, with the commonplace book as signifying the poly-vocal, collective, interactive and process-oriented communication, and the notebook as single-authored and often more focused toward a more narrow, singular purpose. The poly-vocal nature of the commonplace book made it a good fit conceptually for the desire to document the Paperology RAG, which is a large and diverse interdisciplinary collective with many voices. </p>

<p>Our book also takes inspiration from scrapbooking, which Jillian Hess suggests we understand “as a multi-media version of the commonplace book” (CITE - Find page number for quote). To link to scrapbook history, we look to the industrialisation of print. It was during the nineteenth century we see the rise of both printed anthologies as well as scrapbooking, two different practices of collaborative authorship, both made possible by the proliferation of increasingly affordable mass-produced print materials . And by the 1850s, authors such as John Todd in his 1857 “index rerum” suggested the annotated bibliography and index as replacement for the commonplace book, to make the work more efficient (CITE). This suggestion appears in tandem with the refinement of scholarly collection, annotation, and indexing practices which align with values of efficiency dominant in late nineteenth-century industrialisation (CITE). </p>

<p>We might also think of connections to the encyclopedia - add transition here</p>

<p>“Diderot’s encyclopaedia was the first book of the industrial revolution. Technology had not yet changed; manufacturing was still done largely by hand—paper making being a case in point—and in shops, not factories. (…) The Encyclopédie was composed of twenty-eight volumes, with 71,818 articles written by 100 contributors (…) the first volume was published in 1751, and the project continued for nearly thirty years.” Kurlansky p. 231</p>

<p>Note the paper samples in the envelopes also made a nod to the tradition of the card catalogue , which was a later development related to the commonplace book too …</p>

<p>Cite Bonnie Mak and Julia Pollack Cataloging chapter</p>

<p>The forms of the encyclopedia and card catalogue as institutionalised poly-vocal text formats stand in contrast to the tradition of the personal scrapbook, examined by Jessica Helfand in the American context as: </p>

<p>“[…] safe havens for those highly subjective, loopy complications of personal matter. Part personal diary, part cultural stockpile, [scrapbooks] enable us to chronicle the major events and minute details of our own personal odysseys.” Helfand pg. xvi</p>

<p>See for examples Figure X</p>

<p>A little more discussion of the scrapbook, then transition to mail art</p>

<p>And our project is also related to the tradition of Correspondence art or Mail Art - </p>

<p>And Mail Art is an art tradition that is related to collage (which also has scholarly roots in the botanical paper mosaic work of Mary Delany, who is credited with inventing the collage form) and book art (as discussed by Johanna Drucker), </p>

<p>But Mail Art has its more immediate history in Dadaist and Russian formalist art practices (CITE), but which was brought to popular consciousness in the mid-twentieth century as a collaborative outsider art practice with a unique element of chance: putting the artworks at the mercy of the postal system. </p>

<p>Ray Johnson was a key figure in midcentury mail art, who founded the fictional New York School of Correspondence as a playful way to describe the ever growing network of mail artists (CITE). Johnson described the school as follows:</p>

<p>“The only way to understand something of my school is to participate in it for some time. It is secret, private, and without any rule” (CITE)</p>

<p>Scholar Michael Crane (CITE) also highlights the element of “Reference in Johnson’s work, not as academic reference or citation, but as an associative mediator himself, Johnson brought disparate elements and people in relation together. </p>

<p>Like the commonplace book, the encyclopedia, the card catalogue, the scrapbook and the journal, mail art is also a slow form of communication, in opposition to zoom, email, sms, social media, online databases and wikis, and the telephone. But distinct from the commonplace book, which was more often the practice and property of an intellectual elite, the common call for mail art show entries is the egalitarian “No jury, no fee, no return.”</p>

<p>Transition needed</p>

<p>It is exciting to see these historical practices of the commonplace book, the scrapbook, and correspondence art reflected in the creative documentation work of the book project we created together as the Paperology RAG. Perhaps the group itself - its conversations, ephemera, digital and physical traces, affective experience - is indeed a realisation of the “Common Place” that Aristotle had envisioned - in a much deeper way than any material artifact can encompass, but hopefully our collaborative book project gives a sense of.</p>
